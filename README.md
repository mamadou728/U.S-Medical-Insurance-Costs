# U.S-Medical-Insurance-Costs
For this project, Code academy provides a dataset make with information from insurance customers in the United States. The different types of information are the age, sex, BMI, the number of children, the smoking status, the region where there are, and the charges. The first question I asked myself is, what is the average cost of insurance. After that, The second question I asked myself is, what is the relation between the intervals of ages and the average cost of insurance. After having solved these questions, I added conclusions that allow to better understand the behavior of charge of the insurance according to the intervals of ages. For this work, I consider that cost of insurance is well above the average when it exceeds 5%. However, I also consider that the cost of insurance is well below the average when it is 5% low.
